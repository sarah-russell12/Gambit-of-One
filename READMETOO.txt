This project uses code as described in the textbook "SFML Game Development" 
by Artur Moreira, Henrick Vogelius Hansson, and Jan Haller. Most of the
files seen in this project are near-identical to the original code.
Alterations had been made with specifying resources and moving around
enumerations. Documentation in the code is being updated to reflect these
changes.
